<h3>Setting Up Your Profile</h3>
<p><strong>Q: What should I include in my profile?</strong></p>

<h3>Your First Idea Post</h3>
<p><strong>Q: How do I share my startup idea?</strong></p>
<p>A: Go to the "Ideas" section, click "Share New Idea," and describe your concept. Include what problem you're solving, your target audience, and what kind of teammates you need.</p>

<h2>Platform Features</h2>

<h3>Daily Quiz System</h3>
<p><strong>Q: How do daily quizzes work?</strong></p>
<p>A: Each day, you'll receive a new entrepreneurship question covering topics like business strategy, marketing, finance, and leadership. Answer correctly to earn points and track your learning progress.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What happens if I miss a day?</strong></p>
<p>A: No worries! You can catch up on missed quizzes for up to 7 days. Your streak will reset, but you won't lose any learning opportunities.</p>

<h3>Team Formation</h3>

<p><strong>Q: What makes a good team request?</strong></p>
<p>A: Be specific about your idea, explain what role you need filled, and mention why you think they'd be a great fit. Personal, thoughtful messages get better responses than generic ones.</p>
